             <p class="product-heading">Overview of Renaissance Platform</p>
              <p>The Renaissance Platform is modular  and makes use of two key technologies driving innovation in science and finance:</p>
              <br>
              <ul>
              	<li>Massively parallel commoditized GPU cards for 1000x factor speed up.</li>
                <li>Distributed ledger (Blockchain) to solve many operational inefficiencies.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Sell and buy side firms require tools with high throughput to quickly identify trading opportunities, mitigate market, credit, liquidity and trading risk across all major asset classes, spanning short to long-term horizons. Moreover, many regulatory mandates and sound financial best practice approaches require 10s of billions of calculations. Financial firms spend billions on large and expensive private CPU hardware server farms or are urged to put sensitive financial information on hack vulnerable public cloud to address the computational burden. The Renaissance Platform solves this by building the world’s largest and most highly optimized code base for finance on commoditized GPU cards. A typical application that runs in hours on a costly 100 CPU core compute server, takes less than 2 minutes to run on the Renaissance Platform using a $1200 GPU card. </p>

		<p>Distributed ledgers address many settlement, clearing, reconciliation and operational risks in the financial ecosystem. Distributed ledgers eliminate many error prone processes by making intelligent use of workflow automation and synchronization technology. By leveraging a single, permissioned, and network audited history of every transaction, the Renaissance Platform  greatly reduces direct and indirect costs and operational risk. Furthermore,  elegant use of distributed ledgers has the potential to unlock and deliver new sources of revenue.</p><br>

        <p>The Renaissance Platform combines these two technologies in a robust and modular way to save the industry billions annually while streamlining current processes and making them run much faster with greater accuracy.</p> <br>

        <p>Modularity allow clients to consume only what is needed today while future proofing investments. For example, a client can consume only the GPU optimized components to greatly speed up many current applications without using any of the digital ledger components. This  provides a clear path way to future adoption of digital ledgers. </p>

          <p class="product-heading"> Renaissance GPU Economic Scenario Generator</p>

<p>Many applications in finance involve looking at markets and at forward looking values of economic scenarios. Scenario analysis is central to robust risk management and regulatory frameworks such as Basel III, CCAR, and Solvency II. This is often a very time consuming task. Current industry practice is to use grids (public or private) or use less accurate models with crude approximations, or to look at less scenarios to get the task done in reasonable time. The GPU optimized Renaissance ESG module solves this. Very large stochastic scenario sets over short (1-3y) or long term (beyond +50yr)  horizons are computed in minutes on a laptop/desktop using more advance models.  </p><br>

<p>The Renaissance GPU ESG is a highly optimized component that is separately licensable and can be plugged into any existing infrastructure. </p>

<p class="product-heading2">Renaissance ESG Business Benefits:</p>

<p>The Renaissance ESG will allow your firm to meet and exceed the following market and regulatory demands:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="product-heading2">Scenario Generation:</span> whether scenarios are required for Solvency II, variable annuity hedging, long tem cash-flow runoff,  counterparty credit exposure under real world measure, or Dodd-Frank CCAR the extensive set of models and automated calibration tools will transform existing cumbersome and expensive processes.</li>
<li><span class="product-heading2">Stress testing:</span> Automated ability to quantify investment risk and PnL outcomes in near real time when model parameters are stressed for extreme or unexpected events or when management assumptions about future outlook changes.</li>
<li><span class="product-heading2">Regulatory risk management control:</span> Under Basel III and Solvency II firms have to defend both the assumptions of internal models and the business decisions resulting from these assumptions. Renaissance ESG is a self-contained solution with all the required components (Market Consistent, real world, and own views calibration, times series analysis, large model library to account for model risk) in one  package, giving a firm complete control to document and defend any “use-test”.</li>
<li><span class="product-heading2">Strategic asset allocation (SAA) –</span> In SAA analysis one would look at an efficient frontier by looking at expected return and risk from ESG scenarios over one or multiple horizons. Views can be calibrated to this exact horizon to construct the frontier from which the optimal mix of investment assets can be chosen. Because of the speed of the Renaissance ESG, a larger set of views can be analyzed in real time to get better insight on investment performance.</li>
<li><span class="product-heading2">Cost savings:</span> All 80+  models and calibrations for Market Consistent and Real World on the GPU with single license fee. Do a lot more. Spend a lot less.</li>

 <p class="product-heading">Renaissance Valuation Module</p><br>
 <p>Former traders, desk quants, and risk managers designed and optimized the model library for trading and risk management. The Renaissance analytics library is the core component of the Renaissance Valuation module. Over 80+ models are offered across all assets classes including rates, equity, FX, commodities, convertibles, agency callable, structured finance, credit derivatives and inflation. All models are written directly in CUDA© from day one and have been highly optimized for performance on single or multi-GPU hardware.</p><br>

<p>Valuation module is modular and flexible.  Any pension cash flow, insurance product, capital market asset, or any arbitrarily complex cash-flow centric structure such as a company’s entire balance sheet can be modeled using the GPU optimized Smart Contract Language (SCL). Any SCL defined contract will automatically work with Renaissance GPU ESG scenarios and will run on the GPU at hyper speed.  Moreover, because SCL is based on a flexible json template API and interoperates with the Renaissance Smart Contract Engine (SCE) all such structures are automatically supported on the Renaissance Distributed Ledger (RDL)  for workflow automation and synchronization.</p>
<br>
<div class="product-right-color-div">
<P class="product-heading2">Asset Pricing </P><br>
<p>
The Renaissance Valuation module is used for pricing and risk analysis of financial contracts. Contracts are grouped into libraries using a flexible json template API. The flexibility of the API allows contracts to be processed by the hyper fast GPU analytic library, by the Smart Contract Engine (SCE), and by any SQL/NoSQL data store. This allows easy integration into  existing legacy infrastructure, including web ecosystems, that can benefit from hyper fast GPU computations. It also serves as a bridge to the emerging distributed ledger ecosystem through the Renaissance RDL. Investments today are future proofed.</p>

<li>All sensitivities/Greeks are calculated for any arbitrary future time steps for hedge projection and CVA hedging.</li> 

<li>Extendible Contracts. Unlike other scripting languages like Apache Groovy, Haskell, Python, etc., GPU-Smart Contract Language (SCL) is based on a port of some components from the well established Boost library and was designed from day one to 1) leverage all architectural optimizations of the GPU hardware, 2)  be extendible by financial analysts (non-programmers) using a simple template mechanism, and 3) be inter-operable by different components of the Renaissance  Platform such as the GPU analytic library and the Renaissance Smart Contract Engine.</li><br>

<li>In addition to capital market derivatives, pension or insurance contracts, such as variable annuities, can be structured and valued using GPU-SCL. An entire balance sheet can be structured, projected forward in time, and optimized for funding and liquidity optimization in Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) applications.</li> <br> 

<li>Model calibrations are performed in milliseconds even for complex models. Small (1-6 factor) model calibrations are done in milliseconds and large stochastic process basket (S&amp;P 100) model done is a seconds. This includes all allocation/de-allocation between host and device, making this the fastest such library (we know of) in the world.</li><br> 

<li>Full support for historical PnL analysis. All models can automatically be calibrated to any point in history to construct historical PnL going back decades in near real time.</li><br>

<li>Allows ease of compliance with SR 11-17 and other regulatory guidance on use of models.</li><br>

<li>Increase your margins by always being first with the accurate answer and understand the risks before the competition.</li><br>

	<P class="product-heading">GPU Aggregator Module</P><br>

<P>Renaissance GPU Aggregator is the core reporting engine for the Valuation and Risk Management modules. Clients have the ability to aggregate along any user defined dimension. Robust GPU side statistical methods are used for fast and accurate aggregation. User is able to define multiple named aggregation rules to create specific reports for any level of the organization. </P><br>

<P>Mark-to-Market, Mark-to-Model, sensitivities/Greeks, VaR, SVaR, Shortfall/CTE, Basel II FRTB, Solvency Capital, CVA, etc. can be aggregated along any dimension. Results can be aggregated/roll-up by such attribute as trading desk, region, country, business line, portfolio, risk factor class, trader, netting set, contract leg, counterparty or any attribute defined by the user.</P><br>

<P>GPU Aggregator is a stand alone aggregator. No reliance on any other Renaissance module is required in order to use it. Examples of such applications are:</P><br>
<ul>
<li>Solvency II aggregation by an insurer wanting a fast GPU enabled aggregator to use with existing risk and liability modeling systems. No need to license the liability and capital modeling component from Renaissance. Just license the aggregator and use it in any existing database for hyperfast fast aggregation.</li>
<li>A trading firm or commercial bank wanting to use existing front office systems for Basel III FRTB but needing a fast and accurate aggregator. For example a firm can use the ESG to generate scenarios, send the scenarios to front office systems to generate FRTB sensitivities, and finally use Renaissance GPU Aggregator to perform FRTB aggregation.</li> 
<li>Near real time partial aggregations. This applies to a firm who wants to use existing systems to calculate part of the results to be aggregated and rely on Renaissance GPU optimized modules to calculate remaining result set. If a particular application is too slow, that component can be off loaded to Renaissance for fast GPU execution. The two result sets can then be aggregated by Renaissance  GPU Aggregator. For example CVA hedging, portfolio credit products (e.g. CDO, CLO, MBS/ABS) risk and sensitivity, and insurance hedging applications tend to have long execution times. These applications can be offloaded to Renaissance GPU optimized code and the results can be used with a firms other systems to do risk and capital aggregation in near real time with little disruption to existing infrastructure.</li>

<div class="row"><!--  starting of inner row7 -->
<div class="col-md-7">
<p> The Renaissance Distributed Ledger (RDL) is a modular component of the Renaissance Platform designed to eliminate the siloed way modern finance works today. As a single source of network audited  truth, RDL  greatly reduces operational risk, cost, and capital requirements in the payment and processing of financial contracts.</p>

<p>RDL leverages the technology that underpins digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, but is not a crypto-currency platform. RDL is a set of technology components built for consistency, integrity, and scalability in regulated financial markets. RDL is unique as it solves the computational burdens that financial companies face today and will continue to face even with wide adoption of distributed ledgers. RDL is designed to  work with many of the emerging financial distributed ledger APIs. RDL is future proof no matter which distributed ledger platform becomes dominant. </p><br>

<p>Applications as diverse as Basel III, CVA hedging, Solvency II, DFAST/CCAR, and trading and settlement of contracts are supported on the Renaissance Platform.</p>

</div><!-- end of inner row7-->
<p>RDL is a complete current and historical state of all transactions or other data which exists across distinct nodes in a private financial network. As a data store, RDL can replicate part or all its data to any permissioned subset of nodes in the network.  Because common data is audited by other nodes in the network, data integrity and consistency to all nodes is maintained. </p><br>

<p>RDL is made up of three core components:</p><br>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type:decimal;">Renaissance Smart Contract Engine (RSC): RSC mediates between the various GPU optimized modules and synchronization across the distributed ledger. This allows for both hyper fast computation for applications that require fast throughput and settlement/payment processes on permissioned ledger nodes.</li>
<li style="list-style-type:decimal;">Renaissance Ledger Logs and Communication Adaptors (R2LCA). R2LCA handles synchronization across ledger nodes and various digital ledger APIs.</li>
<li style="list-style-type:decimal;">Renaissance Digital Private DB is a local copy of the data, or subset of  the data, that is visible to only permissioned ledger nodes.</li>
</ul>
</section><br> <!-- End of Distributed Layer -->

<section ><!-- starting of  Deployment Options-->
<p class="product-heading">Deployment Options</p><br>

<p>RDL’s modularity allow for a number of possible deployments. This affords companies a measured migration path towards adopting distributed ledgers. The following are some, not all, of the possible deployment options:</p><br>
<ul>
<li>Option 1: GPU component only deployment: under this option only the GPU optimized modules are deployed within existing infrastructure. No RDL distributed ledger components are deployed.</li>
<ul>
  <li>Key benefits: 
  <ul>
<li>many applications such as risk management, Basel III, Solvency II, CVA hedging, CCAR, etc. are run 100x faster.</li>
<li>contracts will work with smart contract engine for future distributed ledger deployment.</li> 
<li>incremental deployment with no upfront large and disruptive distributed ledger platform implementation.</li>  
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li><br>



<li>Option 2: Fully private centralized distributed ledger deployment. Even within a single institution there are many databases and ledgers that have to be maintained for different business lines. Many costly enterprise projects involve simply getting the disperate sources of data into one consolidated place to facilitate enterprise wide analysis. A single source of enterprise truth reduces cost and is more efficient.</li>
<ul>
  <li>Key benefits: 
  <ul>
<li>all the benefits of Option 1.</li>
<li>single source enterprise data store eliminates the siloed infrastructure currently in use.</li>
<li>each business unit can have its own set of private data and allow access only on a permissioned basis.</li> 
<li>audit and other compliance/control functions have full access to a single source of truth.</li>
<li>cost effective means of replacing inflexible and non-transparent (sources of fraud) processes with a scalable distributed db.</li>
<li>sets up organization to move to any distributed ledger in the future when the firm, a specific business line, and industry is ready.</li>
<li>no outside or external view of the distributed ledger/data store is available.</li>
<li>regulators can be permissioned to view certain reports and data. Greatly reduce regulatory compliance cost.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li><br>





<li>Option 3: One-to-many operator distributed ledger deployment: A market operator grants permission to many market players to transact on the ledger. Some data is private to certain ledger nodes and other common data is public to all ledger nodes.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Key benefits: 
  <ul>
<li>all the benefits of Option 1 and most of Option 2.</li>
<li>cryptographic hashes are used on all valid transactions.</li>
<li>one independent and authoritative source of all transaction history.</li>
<li>eliminate need for expensive, error prone, and time consuming independent reconciliations.</li>
<li>immediate settlement of transactions between un-trusting parties.</li> 
<li>run all regulatory reports and risk management functions directly on the ledger data.</li> 
<li>no need for multiple systems or replicate the existing patchwork of systems needed to run a financial institution.</li>
